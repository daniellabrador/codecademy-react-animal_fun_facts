Our program will display a selection of animals on the screen. We’ll be allowed to decide if we want to include a background or not. Clicking an animal will cause a fact to be randomly selected from a list of potential options. The selected fact will pop up on the screen. As we keep clicking, we’ll be able to see different facts.
